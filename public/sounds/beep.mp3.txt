Note: This is a placeholder for beep.mp3
In production, replace this with an actual MP3 audio file.
For development, the app will gracefully handle the missing audio file.

You can generate a simple beep sound using:
- Online tools like freesound.org
- Audio editing software
- Or use a data URI for inline audio

The reminderService will catch and log any audio loading errors.
